Based upon /u/el013/'s "Ultra Minimal One Line userChrome" but cleaned up a little bit and with some changes to make it appeal to me more. [[/r/FirefoxCSS thread]](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/g0o4sg/ultra_minimal_one_line_userchrome_macos_firefox/)

Of course, if you have any issues with this theme, just let me know somehow and I'll get to it.

## Changelog:

**Update [dde44ef]:**
