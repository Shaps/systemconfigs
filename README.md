# Llama's Configs
The magic files that stop my system from looking like garbage.

### Firefox
Based upon /u/el013/'s "Ultra Minimal One Line userChrome" but cleaned up a little bit and with some changes to make it appeal to me more. [[/r/FirefoxCSS thread]](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/g0o4sg/ultra_minimal_one_line_userchrome_macos_firefox/)

Just changelog in the folder for the changes. The general theme is the same but I made a massive number of changes.
