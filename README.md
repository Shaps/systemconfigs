# systemconfigs
The configs I use on my system. 

## Conky
The [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky) on the right of my system is built on ["Helix Conky"](https://www.deviantart.com/figman/art/Helix-Conky-204016625) by figman on DeviantArt

The one on the left is the same deal, but this time it's showing system info.

## Plank
I use the Bytes Plank theme that comes with Plank. [Here's](https://github.com/erikdubois/plankthemes) a repo with a bunch of other themes that I haven't tried.

Settings of possible importance:

```
Icon Size: 46
Hide: On / Autohide
Hide delay: 150
Shot Unpinned: True
```

## Plasma
```
Look and Feel: Sweet (Sets lots of other settings.)
Cursors: Win8
Splash Screen: Breeze
Icons: Papirus Dark
Emoticons: EmojiOne
Kvantum: Sweet
GTK: Breeze-Dark
```

## Polybar
My [Polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar) config is based on adi1090x's [Polybar-2 Grey](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes) just modified to my personal liking.

## Zsh
Regular old [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) theme. Theme's agnoster and the plugins I have loaded are git, adb, colored-man-pages, and cp.
